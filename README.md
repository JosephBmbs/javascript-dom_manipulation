## Introduction

Welcome to the JavaScript DOM Manipulation project! In this project, we'll explore the world of Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation using JavaScript. The DOM represents the structure of web documents and allows us to interact with and modify HTML and XML content dynamically.

## JavaScript

JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, versatile, and dynamic programming language. It was first developed by Brendan Eich in 1995 while he was working at Netscape Communications Corporation. JavaScript was initially created to make web pages more interactive and dynamic.

Over the years, JavaScript has evolved into a powerful and widely-used language for both front-end and back-end development. It plays a crucial role in modern web development, enabling developers to create responsive and interactive user interfaces.

## Learning Objectives

- Select HTML elements in JavaScript.
- Differentiate between ID, class, and tag name selectors.
- Modify HTML element styles dynamically.
- Get and update HTML element content in real-time.
- Manipulate the Document Object Model effectively.
- Make HTTP requests using XmlHTTPRequest.
- Utilize the Fetch API for asynchronous data fetching.
- Bind and listen to DOM events.
- Capture and respond to user interactions with web pages.
